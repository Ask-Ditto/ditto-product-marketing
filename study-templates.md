## Multi-Phase Research (Deep Validation)

For complex products or high-stakes decisions, run iterative studies:

| Phase | Purpose | Panel | Questions |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|
| 1. Pain Discovery | Find the real problem | 10-12 personas | 7 open-ended |
| 2. Deep Dive | Understand requirements, trust, triggers | 10 personas | 7 targeted |
| 3. Concept Test | Validate positioning, pricing, purchase intent | 10 personas | 7 structured |

**Critical:** Each phase's questions should be informed by the previous
phase's findings. This iterative approach produces qualitatively different
results than a single-pass study.

Total time: ~2 hours for all three phases.
Traditional equivalent: 3-6 months.
